# ANSWER

`- in my own understanding the "XY Problem" is about the user wanting to solve the X problem and thinks Y is the solution but they dont know how to do it so they ask how to do Y to others and it becomes a back-and-forth conversation until its revealed that X is actually the real problem. It's also worth noting that because the user thinks that Y could be the solution to X it doesnt necessarily mean that it WILL be the solution.

- The question itself, the link to the curriculum where you are stuck in, the code that you have made or pseudo code, description on what you want happen, and list or paragraph of things you have tried.`
